# Splorp for Tersus

An achingly simple child theme for [Tersus](http://tersustheme.com/).

This theme can be seen in action on [Grant Hutchinson’s personal site](http://splorp.me/).


## About

Tersus is an exercise in publishing template minimalism.

Why create yet another theme? As clean and stripped down as some themes are, we wanted to prune things a bit further.

Tersus was originally named Simplicity — a term that described exactly what the project was all about. However, that was prior to the discovery of a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) theme already using that very name. After a brief discussion, several latin terms were bandied about as replacements. Tersus (which means ‘clean, neat, or cleansed’) seemed to fit the bill rather nicely … and here we are.

A version of Tersus is also being developed for [Tumblr](http://tersustheme.tumblr.com/) and is [available on GitHub](http://github.com/splorp/tersus-tumblr/).

Keep track of Tersus development on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tersustheme).
