# Splorp for Tersus

An achingly simple child theme for [Tersus](http://tersustheme.com/).

This theme can be seen in action on [Grant Hutchinson’s personal site](http://splorp.me/).


## About

Tersus is an exercise in publishing template minimalism.

Why create yet another theme? As clean and stripped down as some themes are, we wanted to prune things a bit further.

Tersus was originally named Simplicity — a term that described exactly what the project was all about. However, that was prior to the discovery of a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) theme already using that very name. After a brief discussion, several Latin terms were bandied about as replacements. Tersus (which means ‘clean, neat, or cleansed’) seemed to fit the bill rather nicely — and here we are.

A version of Tersus is being developed for [Tumblr](http://tersustheme.tumblr.com/) and is also [available on GitHub](http://github.com/splorp/tersus-tumblr/).

Keep track of Tersus development on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tersustheme).


## Features

+ HTML5 structure and compliance
+ CSS that has been reset and built from the ground up
+ Non-semantic, presentational markup has been dispatched
+ Built-in theme options for navigation, sidebar, and announcement text
+ Responsive, adaptive layout for small screens
+ Clean, valid, and awesome


## Child Themes

By removing the majority of the presentational markup from the Tersus parent theme, we’ve opened the door for child themes to pick up the aesthetic slack. There are currently two child themes being developed for Tersus.
